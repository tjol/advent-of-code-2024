# Advent of Code 2024

Few-word reaction to the different days:

- Day 1: Just what you expect from day 1
- Day 2: Shouldn't have tried to be clever on part 2, that was frustrating
- Day 3: Piss easy
- Day 4: Simple. Involved but simple. Part 2 not what I expected.
- Day 5: These are getting harder. But a fairly trivial solution worked.
- Day 6: My solution is simple (and maybe not ideal), but it took me a while to get there.
- Day 7: This one was nice.
- Day 8: Are these getting easier?
- Day 9: Ok *now* they're getting a little more involved
- Day 10: I wondered when we were going to get a map search thing
- Day 11: Part 2 was as easy as it was predictable
- Day 12: We're entering the "there's a trick to it" era of the calendar
- Day 13: I started out thinking I was so clever and got bitten by float accuracy
- Day 14: Part 2 was a surprise!
- Day 15: Don't know if these are getting harder, but they're definitely getting more complicated
