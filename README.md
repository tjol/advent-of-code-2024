# Advent of Code 2024

Few-word reaction to the different days:

- Day 1: Just what you expect from day 1
- Day 2: Shouldn't have tried to be clever on part 2, that was frustrating
- Day 3: Piss easy
- Day 4: Simple. Involved but simple. Part 2 not what I expected.
- Day 5: These are getting harder. But a fairly trivial solution worked.
